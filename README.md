The website includes:

A form page built with HTML to collect user input (Name and Age).

A PHP backend (submit.php) that processes and securely stores the submitted data in a MySQL database named exampp.

A display table page (table.php) that fetches and displays the stored records dynamically using PHP.

A modern and responsive CSS design to enhance the user interface and ensure usability.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For building the structure and form layout.

CSS: For styling the form and table, providing a clean and professional look.

PHP: For server-side scripting to handle form submission and data retrieval.

MySQL: To store and manage the submitted user data.



This project demonstrates the integration of front-end and back-end technologies to build a complete data entry and display system.
